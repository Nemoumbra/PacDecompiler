A spiritual successor to the [PacViewer by Owocek](https://github.com/owodzeg/PacViewer).

This is an RE suite for working with Patapon PAC files. So far it doesn't support assembling or emitting the IR (and, naturally, it doesn't decompile to a high-level language).
It still lacks the proper interface, but the API is already very powerful. I welcome all and any PRs or Issues, because this project needs to be completed.
